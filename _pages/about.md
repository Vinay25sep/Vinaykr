Hello! I’m **Vinay Kumar**, a Ph.D. scholar in **Computer Science** at **South Asian University, New Delhi, India**. My research focuses on **Optical Networks, Communication Systems, QoS Optimization, Network Virtualization, Quantum Communication, and Resource Allocation**.  

I specialize in **modeling, algorithm design, and system architecture** for communication and computer networks, striving to bridge the gap between **theoretical methodologies and real-world applications**. My goal is to develop **reliable, secure, adaptive, and intelligent networks** by leveraging **optimization, queueing theory, graph theory, and machine learning**.  

Recently, my work has focused on **network virtualization, optical networking, and computing-aware networks**, where I design and implement **fundamental algorithms** for **next-generation network routing and optimization**. I am particularly passionate about enhancing **spectrally-spatially elastic optical networks (SS-EONs)** to improve efficiency, scalability, and performance in modern network infrastructures.
I have actively contributed to international conferences and peer-reviewed journals throughout my academic journey, collaborating with esteemed researchers and industry experts to tackle complex networking challenges. My work explores areas like crosstalk-aware virtual network embedding, spectrum optimization, and multi-core fiber networks, aiming to enhance network efficiency and scalability.

Beyond research, I have experience as a teaching assistant, mentoring students in computer networks and network programming. I have also participated in hackathons, tech workshops, and volunteering initiatives, fostering my interest in innovation and collaboration.

I am always open to discussing emerging network technologies, optimization techniques, and interdisciplinary collaborations. Let’s connect and explore new possibilities in networking and beyond!
